            “Music has always been a big part of my life. I started singing in 2006 
            and  realized how much I love to perform and I never looked back. I finished my 
            Music degree at the University of Pretoria in Jazz Vocals and opened Vanilla Vocals 
            soon after. 
            
            
            We are all born with the same mechanics; it's just our minds that need some 
            coaching. Yes, some of us are born with more talent than others but singing 
            is definitely something that all human beings can do and make something special
             of. 
            It is extremely rewarding to see people go out of their comfort zones, and 
            experience new parts of themselves they didn't know existed.
            
            I’ve been coaching since 2012. I worked on Tv shows editing sound and gained 
            experienceperforming at weddings, corporate events restaurants and parties. 
            Over the years
             I’ve explored different singing styles and techniques determined to find the best 
            solutions and exercises for vocalist to overcome problems and developing 
            once voice.”

                    “In His grace, God has given us different gifts for doing certain things well. 
                    So if God has given you the ability to prophesy, speak out with as much faith 
                    as God has given you. If your gift is serving others, serve them well. If you are 
                    a teacher, teach well. If your gift is to encourage others, be encouraging. 
                    If it is giving, give generously. If God has given you leadership ability, 
                    take the responsibility seriously. And if you have a gift for showing kindness 
                    to others, do it gladly.” -Romans 12:6-8
