              <strong>What to expect</strong> 
                <br><br>
                <p>The first time visiting Vanilla Vocals will be different than your following lessons. 
                    A vocal evaluation will determine your range, vocal capabilities and voice type. 

                    <br>
                    
                    Your vocal evaluation will be 30 minutes and you will also have the opportunity to meet your coach and talk to her about what your goals are.
                
                    <br>

                    Lessons are at least once a week for thirty, forty-five or sixty minutes. 
                    During lessons there will be focused on breathing, vocal technique and vocal fitness. 
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    Depending on the challenges you face as a singer, lessons will be tailored 
                    to suit you. The coach will also help you to choose an appropriate song 
                    for your voice type.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Working towards a common goal</strong> 

                    <br><br>

                    Vanilla Vocals’ students perform at many competitions and concerts throughout the year. If this is something you would like to do, you and your couch will work on four songs in different genres. 

                    <br>
                    
                    It doesn't matter how big or small your goal is but it is important to set goals for 
                    yourself, it can be to broaden your vocal range, learn a certain song, record your own song or a cover song, or even just to let go a little and have fun. 

                    <br>
                    
                    Talk to you coach about your goals.

            <div>
                <p>We like to encourage our vocal students to learn at least one other instrument. The Ukulele is a very easy to learn and a wonderful instrument to use when writing your own songs. This is also a great instrument for children interested in guitar who’s hands are still a bit too small. Ukulele lessons are only for beginners. </p>

            <div class="pro"><h1>ProTools</h1></div>
